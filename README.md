# Prediction-on-Used-Water

This project is used to complement my academic process, especially in conducting research on my undergraduate thesis. In this research process aims to find the predictive value of several input values. This input value is obtained from water use data in Batu City.

The water usage data is divided into several features. In this study, I divided it between 1 and 10. This data also has the nature of historical data, with a time span of 1 month for each existing data.
